# Extreme-Learning-Machine-Based-Recommendation-System

This is an application of [Extreme Learning Machine](http://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/egbhuang/) to the domain of collaborative filtering . I have implemented the item-item and user-user based model for collaborative filtering and compared their performance.

## Libraries Required :
1. [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)
2. [scipy](https://www.scipy.org/)
3. [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/)
4. [hpelm](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/hpelm/1.0.1)

## Instructions:

### To run the user-user based model
```
python Assignment+3+user_user_model.py
```

### To run the item-item based model
```
python Assignment+3+item_item_model.py
```
